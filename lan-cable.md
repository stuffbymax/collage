## Introduction to LAN Cables

LAN (Local Area Network) cables are essential for connecting devices to a network, often used to connect computers, routers, and switches. These cables generally use twisted pairs of wires to reduce electromagnetic interference and improve data transmission.

## LAN Cable Categories

### Category 5e (Cat5e)
- **Max Speed**: 1 Gbps
- **Max Bandwidth**: 100 MHz
- **Max Distance**: 100 meters
- **Use Case**: Home networks, office networks with moderate traffic.

### Category 6 (Cat6)
- **Max Speed**: 10 Gbps (up to 55 meters)
- **Max Bandwidth**: 250 MHz
- **Max Distance**: 100 meters (for 1 Gbps)
- **Use Case**: High-speed networks, data centers, modern office environments.

### Category 6a (Cat6a)
- **Max Speed**: 10 Gbps
- **Max Bandwidth**: 500 MHz
- **Max Distance**: 100 meters
- **Use Case**: High-speed enterprise networks, ideal for large file transfers and streaming.

## LAN Cable Color Coding

### TIA/EIA-568A Standard

The TIA/EIA-568A standard is a wiring scheme for terminating network cables.


### TIA/EIA-568B Standard

This is another common wiring standard for LAN cables, and is more widely used than 568A.


### Color Coding Comparison Table

| Pin No | TIA/EIA-568A | TIA/EIA-568B |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| 1      | White/Green  | White/Orange |
| 2      | Green        | Orange       |
| 3      | White/Orange | White/Green  |
| 4      | Blue         | Blue         |
| 5      | White/Blue   | White/Blue   |
| 6      | Orange       | Green        |
| 7      | White/Brown  | White/Brown  |
| 8      | Brown        | Brown        |

## Straight-Through vs Crossover Cables

### Straight-Through Cable

A straight-through cable uses the same standard (either TIA/EIA-568A or TIA/EIA-568B) on both ends. It is used to connect different types of devices, such as:
- Computer to switch/router
- Switch to router

### Crossover Cable

A crossover cable uses TIA/EIA-568A on one end and TIA/EIA-568B on the other. It is used to connect similar devices, such as:
- Computer to computer
- Switch to switch

## Conclusion

LAN cables play an essential role in establishing network connections. Understanding the different cable categories, their speed, and bandwidth limitations, as well as the correct color coding (568A and 568B standards), is crucial for setting up reliable network connections.
