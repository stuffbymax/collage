# Draft Proposal Document for Wind Waves Kiosk Project

Hi Norman,

Please find below my draft proposal for the Wind Waves Kiosk project. This document outlines the design approach, core functionalities, and additional ideas to enhance the overall user experience.

## Project Overview

The **Wind Waves Kiosk** project aims to create a visually engaging and user-friendly application that will serve as an interactive touchpoint for users. Our goal is to ensure that users can easily navigate, access information, and enjoy an intuitive interface.

## Design Approach

### Simplistic and Modern Design

For this initial draft, I’ve adopted a **minimalist design** focusing on simplicity and clarity. I chose **Arial** as the main font due to its readability and clean aesthetic, pairing it with a neutral **gray background** to maintain a modern look and ensure visual accessibility. Although this design was created quickly, the simplicity aligns with modern trends, which often favor clean lines and an uncluttered layout.

### Wireframes and Visual Assets

The current wireframe is a preliminary draft, and while I have many ideas for improving it, this layout provides a foundational structure for the app. The wireframe includes basic elements and functions we discussed, but additional adjustments can be made based on your feedback.

## Core Functionalities

1. **Interactive Navigation**
   - Users will be able to explore various sections of the kiosk app through a simple, intuitive menu. The navigation will be designed to minimize taps and clicks required to access each section.
   - Each menu item will be clearly labeled, using high-contrast text for easy readability.

2. **Content Display**
   - **Text Content:** All descriptions and information will use large, legible text to ensure clarity.
   - **Image/Video Sections:** Dedicated sections for visual media, optimized for quick loading and high resolution.

3. **Weather and Wave Forecast Integration**
   - Real-time weather and wave conditions will be displayed on the main screen, using a straightforward layout that updates automatically. This will give users immediate access to essential information.

## Additional Ideas and Enhancements

As I worked on the project, I developed additional ideas to enhance the kiosk experience. These ideas are not yet reflected in the current wireframe but could add value to the final product:

1. **Interactive Map Integration**
   - Adding a map feature where users can view local beaches, surf spots, and wave conditions would increase engagement. Users could tap on map points to view details and images for each location.

2. **Visual and Audio Enhancements**
   - Incorporating gentle animations or background sounds (like ocean waves) could immerse users in the experience, making the kiosk more engaging without overwhelming them.

3. **Real-time Notifications and Alerts**
   - Implementing a notification system for surf warnings or significant weather changes could add value, helping users stay informed.

4. **User Feedback and Survey Options**
   - Adding a feedback or survey section to gather user insights can help improve future iterations of the app.

## Closing Notes

While I may revise the wireframe, I feel confident in the additional documents and assets provided. This draft should offer a solid foundation for our project discussions and give a clear idea of the proposed functionality and layout. I’m excited to refine these concepts with your feedback and am confident that the final product will align with your vision.

Thank you for considering my initial proposal, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

**Best regards,**
